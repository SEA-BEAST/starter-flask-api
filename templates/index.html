    <h2>what is a dinosaur?</h2>
    <p>A dinosuar is,by definition,a extict reptile from the mezizoic era.So dinosuars are basiclly huge reptiles.However one thing that is interesting is that dinosaurs are closer in genetic family to birds than any reptile.Now some birds definately look somewhat like dinosuars like the ostrich, emu, or cassowary.but other birds such as the chickedee, crow, or robin do not look like dinosuars at all.Anyways we will cover that later.Our story starts at the last super continent...Pangea</p>
   <h2>Pangea</h2>
    Pangea was the last supercontinent to ever exist, the first being rodinia.Pangea existed from the early carboniferouse all the way to the late triassic.If you dont know what pangea is it is basically all of the contienents we have today (2024) mergedinto one.Later the continental drift would happen and pangea would break into the contienents we have today.
